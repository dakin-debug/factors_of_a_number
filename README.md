Factors Finder

A simple Python program that prints all the factors of a given positive integer.

How It Works

The program:
1. Asks the user to input a positive integer.
2. Loops through all numbers from 1 to that number.
3. Prints out each number that divides it exactly (with no remainder).

Sample Run

```text
Enter a positive integer: 12
1 is a factor of 12
2 is a factor of 12
3 is a factor of 12
4 is a factor of 12
6 is a factor of 12
12 is a factor of 12
